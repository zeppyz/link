INT. JANINE’S CLASSROOM - DAY
JANINE (late 20s, Black, ball of optimistic energy, quirky,
bookish, ready to take on the world) is mid-lesson sitting
with some 2ND GRADERS at their desks.
JANINE
Nina! Wonderful sentence structure.
(reading)
“My favorite movie is Toy Story and
my favorite character is Woody.”
(then, to Nina)
Me too. Well, I’m a Buzz girl. I
like his ambition. BEYOND infinity?
He dreams big.
Janine moves to another student, BRITTANY.
JANINE (CONT’D)
And Brittany- “My favorite movie is
“American Gangster and my favorite
character is Frank Lucas?” Ok,
excellent performance by Denzel,
but a little too colorful for the
movie wall. What about... Moana?
BRITTANY
Ok. I like Moana!
JANINE
Okay! And I will be having a third
talk with your mom about what
you’re watching at home!
Janine takes the papers to her desk. A student, SHAWN, yells.
SHAWN
Ow. Ms. Beeman, Andrew hit me!
JANINE
Andrew, apologize! I’m gonna count
to three! One, two, three...four...
ANDREW shows no signs of apologizing. Janine keeps counting.
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE (CONT’D)
I’m Janine Beeman. Been teaching
second grade here at Harrity for
two years. As a product of the
Philadelphia school system, I’m
proud to say I survived, and can
now teach here today!
INT. JANINE’S CLASSROOM - DAY
TWO KIDS are sharing singular desks while learning a lesson.
Janine holds up a HISTORY BOOK and shows the last page which
reads: “CURRENT U.S PRESIDENT: GEORGE BUSH.”
JANINE
Now, kids, there have been three
presidents since this one. Old
book. Here are the others!
Janine flips the page to show where she has printed out
photos of BARACK OBAMA, DONALD TRUMP, and JOE BIDEN.
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE (CONT’D)
The main problem in this district
is, yeah, no money. The city says
there isn’t any, but they’re
building a new half-billion-dollar
Eagles’ stadium down the street.
ANGLE ON: B-roll of the huge stadium being built.
JANINE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
...Seems like they have the money.
We just make do. The staff here is
amazing.
- Shot of MELISSA PETERSON’s (50s, very South Philly Italian,
tough mob-wife energy) class. The classroom is well
controlled. She teaches from the board.
JANINE (CONT’D)
They’re incredible teachers.
- Shot of BARBARA WATSON’s (50s, Black, motherly, confident,
suffers no fools but is soft on the inside) class. She’s
reading to her kindergarten class.
JANINE (CONT’D)
I look up to them all.
- Shot of the chaotic classroom of MS. SCHWARTZ (20’s, white,
in over her head). Kids run and scream. Ms. Schwartz panics
at her desk.
MS. SCHWARTZ
Sit... down!
A globe is thrown at her from the back of the classroom.
JANINE TALKING HEAD
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 2.
JANINE
Well, I look up to the older
teachers. We younger teachersstill
getting the hang of it!
- Shot of child setting a trashcan on fire. JACOB HILL (20s,
white, painfully woke, a performative liberal cool nerd type)
puts it out with a fire extinguisher.
JANINE (CONT’D)
If we don’t wind up leaving.
- Shot of younger TEACHER holding a box of her belongings
walking out the front door. She turns and gives a middle
finger to camera.
JANINE (CONT’D)
Look- this school is rough, but I
became a teacher to make sure
students come out alive, and that
ultimately means doing whatever I
can to make this school a better
place for these kids. And after
learning a lot in my first year,
subbing out therapy for axethrowing...
INT. AXE-THROWING STUDIO - DAY
Janine throws an axe straight on the bullseye. She turns and
gives a thumbs up to the camera.
AS WE WERE
JANINE
I finally feel on top of things.
Suddenly, Janine hears a whizzing sound in the background. We
see a CHILD with his back turned toward Janine.
JANINE (CONT’D)
Jamar, what are you doing?!
JAMAR
The toilets don’t work!
JANINE
And the rug was plan B?!
END COLD OPEN
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 3.
ACT ONE
INT. JANINE’S CLASSROOM - DAY
Janine is rolling up the soiled carpet. Meanwhile, her
students are occupied dancing to a video of ‘Baby Shark’.
STUDENT 1
Janine, why are you putting the rug
away?
JANINE
Erica, I told you to call me Ms.
Beeman, Ok? I’m an adult, though,
we’re the same height. And we can’t
use this one anymore. There’s a
little too much pee on it. Even
before Jamar did that.
STUDENT 2
Where will we sit for story time?
And morning lesson?
JANINE
...I’ll figure something out.
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE (CONT’D)
Losing the rug is a huge “L.” Big
deal. For primary classes, the rug
is like a calm island among a wild
sea. An oasis for the kids. Which I
now realize is the opposite of an
island. Okay, it's either land in
water or water in land. Let's just
say it's like Xanax. It's a big
Xanax you can sit on.
Janine’s kids start to run wild as Barbara enters.
BARBARA
Janine, turn that down. I’m trying
to teach my kindergarteners the
letter C, and they’re distracted
with that song. It’s like “Back
That Azz Up” for kids.
JANINE
Sorry, Ms. Watson- hey guys, sit
down! This is not playtime. I’m
counting! One, two...
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 4.
The kids and continue to run wild. Barbara clears her throat.
BARBARA
And I’m not counting. SIT... DOWN.
The kids all find their seats immediately.
JANINE
You’re so good at that, Barbara.
Can’t wait to get there! Who’s
watching your class, by the way?
BARBARA
No one. They’re in a single-file
line in the hallway.
Janine peeks out to see Barbara’s students.
STUDENTS
Good morning, Ms. Beeman.
Janine waves in awe. Barbara walks out, ready to take her
kids back to class, but Janine keeps talking.
JANINE
Incredible. You know, you remind me
so much of my favorite teacher from
3rd grade, Ms. Elliot. Good with
kids, well-dressed, a wizard with a
glue gun...
BARBARA
Well, that’s sweet, Janine. Very
nice. Thank you-
JANINE.
I wanted to be just like her. I was
like... obsessed with her,
actually. In my report card note,
she wrote “A bit clingy. Needs
friends her own age.” She was a
hoot. Anyway, Did you get my email
about getting together after work
to get drinks tonight?
BARBARA
No... uh, must’ve gone to spam.
JANINE
So weird how those do that with you
and no one else.
Barbara glances at the camera.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 5.
INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER
Janine walks in. Jacob is sitting at a table on his phone.
JACOB
Janine! So, update... I quote
tweeted that Senator’s tweet with
“Tweet this next to your hooker?”
and Rachel Maddow liked it, so I
basically work for MSNBC now-
JANINE
Jacob, I told you, if I cared about
Twitter I’d have one.
JACOB
Yeah... but... Rachel Maddow!
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE
I’d say my closest friend here is
Jacob. And that’s really only
because we came in together last
year with twenty other teachers.
We’re two of the three left. So,
trauma bonding, I guess?
JACOB TALKING HEAD
JACOB
What’s this for again? Oh, not HBO?
I’m sure it’ll still be good. I’m
Jacob Hill. I teach history but
live in the present. Subscriber to
Shaun King’s email list-
AS WE WERE
Janine stands at the table with Jacob, Pop-Tart in hand.
JANINE
Hey, you into cheesesteaks from the
corner store for lunch? I’ve been
craving uncleaned-grill meat.
JACOB
No, not there. The guy behind the
counter there calls me “white boy.”
JANINE
Well, you’re the only one for miles
so. It’s like a term of endearment.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 6.
JACOB
No, because then everyone in the
store laughs. Even the cat behind
the counter kind of snickers.
JANINE
Then, why not just ask him to stop?
JACOB
I can’t! It’d be wrong. There’s an
entire chapter in ‘White Fragility’
on this. Robin DiAngelo says-
JANINE
(seeing Melissa)
Melissa, could you tell Ta-Nehisi
Quotes here that “white boy” is a
term of endearment from the corner
store people?
MELISSA
For Zach Ertz, yeah. But for him,
it’s an insult.
Jacob scoffs. Melissa laughs then clocks the camera.
MELISSA TALKING HEAD
MELISSA (CONT’D)
Ehh... Melissa... Peterson. Secondgrade
teacher. You Italian? No. You
from South? Oh. You’se guys working
with cops, you gotta tell me...
AS WE WERE
Barbara walks into the lounge and heads for the coffee.
BARBARA
Morning everyone.
JANINE
Morning again, Barbara! Would you
like to join us for lunch? We’re
thinking cheesesteaks, but whatever
you want is good too.
BARBARA
What I want... is to have my coffee
in peace right now.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 7.
JANINE
Alright! Then I will circle back
later! Guys, I need a new rug for
my room. Mine is officially done.
JACOB
Ooh, same. I shook mine out and
then all the asthma kids had to go
to the nurse’s office.
MELISSA
Mine is sprouting mushrooms but
making for a good science lesson.
JANINE
Wait, if we all need new rugs, what
if we just push to get some using
school budget?
The teachers shrug in agreement. Barbara less so.
AVA COLEMAN (mid-40s, Black, aloof, loud, tone-deaf, always
wants to be center of attention) enters wearing an “Eagles
Stadium 2021 Sweatshirt” and a large hat.
AVA
What it do, baby-boos! What do
y’all think of the little film crew
I brought in?
MELISSA
Distracting. Makes our jobs harder.
AVA
But exciting! We’ll be on tv!
BARBARA
...Because they’re covering
underfunded, poorly managed public
schools in America.
AVA
No press is bad press, Barb. Just
look at Mel Gibson. Still thriving!
‘Daddy’s Home Two’ was hilarious!
Ava laughs. The teachers all look at Ava disgusted.
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE
Ava has a unique take on her job.
MELISSA TALKING HEAD
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 8.
MELISSA
She’s bad at her job. What’s unique
is that she’s bad at her job.
Ava shows the doc crew her TikTok account “principalmoves”
with videos of her line dancing.
AVA
I’m one of the oldest people on the
platform. Ain’t that cool?
She then attempts to get a WORKING TEACHER to dance with her.
MELISSA TALKING HEAD
MELISSA
Just bad.
Ms. Schwartz enters the room, frazzled, and walks right up to
Ava.
MS. SCHWARTZ
Ava, can I talk to you? I need an
aide. I’m outnumbered, the kids are
crazy... One of them told me to
“mind my six” this morning. I don’t
know what that means! I need help.
AVA
Calm down! They’re just kids.
Besides, aides cost money. And we
don’t have that. Do you want to
split your salary up and give it to
someone else? No? Didn’t think so.
JANINE
Well, if we can’t afford aides, is
it possible we could afford new
rugs? Might help with student
behavior! Clean classrooms lead to
clean... behavior? I think-
AVA
All I’m hearing is new, new, new...
need, need, need. But Barbara, one
of the best and most senior
teachers here, never complains.
Barbara, what is your secret?
BARBARA
Knowing there isn’t much you can do
to help, Ava.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 9.
AVA
So understanding. Be like Ms.
Watson, people!
Ava gives a smile to camera and leaves. Ms. Schwartz sighs.
MS. SCHWARTZ
But... I’m not Ms. Watson.
BELL RINGS. Teachers head out. Janine comforts Ms. Schwartz.
JANINE
Try some counting exercises, Tina!
It works for me. Somewhere, between
one and forty, the kids calm down.
MS. SCHWARTZ
Okay. Any tips for when they bite
you and call you the B-word?
MELISSA
A kid bit me once and locked on. I
stared him right in the eyes and
said ‘harder.’ Establish dominance
early.
Ms. Schwartz runs out of the room. Barbara and Melissa laugh.
JANINE
You know, a little support might
help make things happen, ladies!
BARBARA
Baby, my support was going to do
about as much as that Target bra
you got on: little to nothing.
Janine self-consciously crosses her arms.
JANINE
It’s not impossible to get stuff!
Melissa asked for new toy registers
for her classroom and got them.
MELISSA
Those aren’t toys. They’re real.
JANINE
Really? Then how’d you get ‘em?
MELISSA
I know a guy who worked a Walmart
demolition. I got a guy for
everything. You need rebar?
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 10.
BARBARA
Melissa’s resourceful. Capable.
They can’t teach that at UPenn.
JANINE
While I’m honored you remembered my
Alma Mater, Barbara, I feel the
younger teachers are capable...
BARBARA
Really? Then why is Ms. Schwartz’s
hair falling out?
Barbara picks up a chunk of hair that fell where Ms. Schwartz
was standing. Janine gags.
BARBARA (CONT’D)
Why does Jacob need a smoke break
every two seconds?
JACOB
Switched to an herbal vape, but ok.
BARBARA
And why can’t any of you make it
past two years? More turnovers than
a bakery.
JANINE
Well, I’m different.
BARBARA
We’ll see. Or, you’ll crack. Like
the rest of em’ do.
This sticks with Janine. Barbara and Melissa exit. Janine,
Jacob, and Ms. Schwartz remain.
JACOB
Ouch. I think we should still try
for rugs. I believe that when
people are unjustly oppressed they
shouldn’t let others set rules...
JANINE
Jacob... what did I say about
quoting Malcolm X unnecessarily?
JACOB
You told to me stop.
JANINE (CONT'D)
I told you to stop.

INT. JANINE'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE
I respect Ms. Watson, but she’s
wrong on this. And, look, I know
the newbie track record here isn’t
great, but at the end of the day,
we’re passionate and capable of
doing this job.
A ten-year-old student, MYA, bursts into the room.
MYA
Janine! Ms. Schwartz kicked Rajon
in the head and everyone is in the
hallway going crazy! Come look!
INT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Janine runs out to see students crowded around a hurt RAJON,
and Ms. Schwartz, who holds her ankle. Barbara breaks it up.
JANINE
What on earth happened?
MS. SCHWARTZ
He hit me first!!!
RAJON
Liar!
MS. SCHWARTZ
Oh, you little-
As the feud continues, Janine looks at Barbara, embarrassed.
BARBARA
I wonder if she tried counting?
END OF ACT ONE
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 12.
ACT TWO
INT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
Janine is ushering students back into their classrooms,
giving a worried look to camera. The other teachers are
helping, but also visibly concerned.
JACOB/MELISSA/BARBARA TALKING HEADS
JACOB
You do NOT hit a kid. It’s like the
one thing you don’t do.
BARBARA
You can yell at them...
MELISSA
(stern)
Threaten them.
JACOB
Warn them about juvenile detention.
BARBARA
Closest I’ve come was maybe, a lil’
pinch. But a kick? Whew, chile.
MELISSA
Threaten their parents.
JACOB
...You just don’t kick a kid.
INT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
Janine anxiously approaches the teachers.
JANINE
Look, maybe this wouldn’t have
happened if she had an aide.
BARBARA
This happened because Ms. Schwartz
was bad at her job and went UFC on
an eight-year-old.
Janine is discouraged by that response as Ava appears.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 13.
AVA
OK! So. Not good! Ms. Schwartz was
out of line, and clearly not fit to
handle her class.
MELISSA
You hired her-
AVA
So, I have done the right thing,
which was to fire her immediately.
Then, I realized it was only nine
A.M, so I hired a sub. In the
meantime, Mr. Johnson is watching
her class. IJANINE
Wait... Mr. Johnson, the janitor?
CUT TO:
INT. MS. SCHWARTZ’S CLASSROOM - DAY
MR. JOHNSON (70s, tired-looking) writes the word “COLLATERAL
LOAN” on the board. The children just stare.
BACK TO:
INT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
JACOB
I think we should maybe alert the
school district of this. I mean, a
child was harmed.
AVA
Aht-Aht! I handled this! No need
for them to know a kid was “harmed”
on my watch- the school’s watch.
Janine looks at the camera.
JANINE
It’s not handled. There’s a 70-yearold
custodian who voted for Kanye
teaching social studies. We need
help! I know there’s no money but-
AVA
Ok, fine, alright?. Look, I’ll make
a small emergency budget request to
the school district.
(MORE)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 14.
We’ll use it to get aides or
whatever else we need. Ok, happy
now?
Jacob nudges Janine. Janine realizes the opportunity.
JANINE
I have an idea for something else
we need! How ‘bout-
AVA
Sure, sure, sure. Just email me the
request.
(to camera)
Another day of principal life! I
believe the children are the fu-turrah...
Janine crosses to Barbara.
JANINE
Look at that! Ask and receive.
BARBARA
And it only took one of you
injuring a child. Congrats.
JANINE
(quick)
The why doesn’t matter.
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE (CONT’D)
Finally, a real chance to get
something nice for this school! And
send an email? I don’t want to
brag, but in college, I won the
Women’s Socialist Club’s ‘Email of
the Month’ award twice. Both emails
were to the dean about recognizing
us as a club. Second one worked.
INT. ADMINISTRATOR’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Teachers are between classes as GREGORY WRIGHT (20s, Black,
handsome, a little self-serious and has a little trouble
connecting with his emotions) walks in holding a briefcase.
GREGORY
Hello, I’m looking for Ms. Coleman.
AVA (CONT'D)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 15.
AVA
(flirty)
Well, hello.
GREGORY
I’m Gregory Wright. The sub for...
(looks at paperwork)
the teacher who punted a student?
AVA
Oh, you’re the sub! Forgive me, I
thought one of my colleagues here
hired a stripper for me, as a joke.
GREGORY
O...kay?
AVA
Everyone, meet Gregory! He’ll be
taking over for Ms. Schwartz for
the foreseeable future-
GREGORY
For the day.
AVA
Right!
(whispers to Melissa)
I’d like to see his ruler.
Melissa scoffs.
BARBARA
Very nice to meet you, young man.
MELISSA
Nice to meet you, Ryan.
GREGORY
It’s Gregory.
MELISSA
We’ll see how long you’ll be here
then I’ll remember your name, Tim.
Jacob approaches out of nowhere, arms wide open for a hug.
JACOB
My dude!
Gregory rejects the hug, shakes Jacob’s hands instead.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 16.
JACOB (CONT’D)
Keepin’ it profesh’ I like it! I’m
Jacob. Always great to see another
male teacher. Not many of us! Now,
I’ll have someone to talk sports
with! You into women’s tennis?
(smugly, to camera)
Or as I call it: regular tennis?
GREGORY TALKING HEAD
GREGORY
I came to Philly from Baltimore at
the start of the school year. I
interviewed to be the principal of
this school, actually. Was pretty
sure I was a shoo-in but apparently
there was someone better?
CUT TO:
INT. AVA’S OFFICE - DAY
AVA
I go to the same church as the
superintendent... Caught him
cheating on his wife with the
deaconess... I needed a job!
INT. JANINE’S CLASSROOM - DAY
Janine is typing up an email titled: “IS YOUR SCHOOL SICK?
TRY PRESCRIPTION RUGS!” Her students watch an educational
movie. Suddenly, they all yell “EW.” Janine looks up to see
that a student, BRIA, vomited at her desk.
JANINE
Bria, What happened?!
BRIA
I threw up.
JANINE
Got that. Let’s get you cleaned up.
INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Janine, holding Bria’s hand, goes to push the bathroom door
open. At the same time, the door swings out from the opposite
direction and a frantic, wet Gregory exits with a child’s
pants in his hands. Janine screams:
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 17.
JANINE
Ah!! Random man! Child pants!
GREGORY
What? Oh, no-
JANINE
Security!
GREGORY
No! I’m Gregory! Look, I’m a sub
for Ms. Schwartz!
JANINE.
Oh! Okay... That’s still not
explaining the pants! Security!
GREGORY
Stop! Look, one of my kids had to
go to the bathroom, so I brought
him. But then he accidentally
“went” on himself.
JANINE
Ohhhhhhhh. Hence the pants! Ok.
GREGORY
Yes. And if that wasn’t bad enough
he tried to flush the toilet and it
shot water back up into the air!
JANINE
Oh, no one told you about reversytoilet!
I’m sorry. Which student...
(looks into stall)
Antoine. Ok, don’t worry.
Janine takes her scarf off of her neck, looking like she’s
getting ready to handle the situation.
JANINE (CONT’D)
Antoine was in my class last year.
Pretty sure I have some spare
clothes left over for him...
Antoine, I’m coming in!
GREGORY
Ok. Thank you.
JANINE
Could you just... watch her...
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 18.
Gregory, repulsed by the vomit, holds Bria’s hand. Janine
goes into the bathroom. When she comes out, Antoine is
wrapped in the scarf.
JANINE (CONT’D)
I’ll take him back to my class and
then have him go back to you, ok?
GREGORY
Ok. Wait... what’s your name?
JANINE
Oh! Silly me. I’m Janine.
The two go to shake hands.
JANINE (CONT’D)
Oh. Oops.
(looks at her hand)
There’s... pee.
GREGORY
(looks at his hand)
Yeah, vomit.
JANINE
(laughs)
Make a wish!
GREGORY TALKING HEAD
GREGORY
That was disgusting. But she seems
nice. Like a bathroom Superwoman.
INT. BARBARA'S CLASSROOM - DAY 2
Janine walks into Barbara’s classroom excitedly.
JANINE
Mrs. Watson! Question for you-
BARBARA
Equals four!
STUDENTS
(unanimously)
Equals four.
Janine realizes she interrupted a lesson. She calms down.
JANINE
Sorry! I just want to get your
expert eye on my email to Ava-
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 19.
BARBARA
Janine, we’re not getting rugs.
JANINE
Ms. Watson, I know you love to rain
on parades, that’s your thing, but
have some faith! Ava literally said
she’ll get us whatever we need.
BARBARA
You think you’re the first person
to try to get things? You think we
like sitting on nasty rugs and
smelling dead mice in the walls?
JANINE
So that’s what that smell is!
BARBARA
I’ve been working in the
Philadelphia School district for
twenty years. Harrity for fifteen.
Ava’s just the latest in a long
line of principals who do nothing
but make things worse. So take all
that Disney princess energy and use
it to do your job.
JANINE
This is me doing the job! I think
the job means trying to make things
better. It means putting pressure
on our leaders to help us.
BARBARA
And I think the job is working with
what you got so you don’t get let
down.
The loudspeaker “DING” goes off, followed by Ava’s voice:
AVA (O.S)
(belches)
Ugh... that hoagie came back up...
Oh damn, am I on? Good morning,
teachers. Please bring your
students to the yard for a special
announcement about some much-needed
improvements to the school that I
made happen!
JANINE
Ah! Ah! You hear that?! Optimism
wins again.
(MORE)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 20.
(doing Ms. Watson
impression)
Thank you, Janine!
(back to Janine’s regular
voice)
Oh, no problem Ms. Watson! I was
just doing my job. I won't even say
I told you so.
(back as Ms. Watson)
But you DID tell me so! You know, I
guess you are very smart and
capable and maybe I could learn
some things from you, Janine.
Barbara stares at Janine who continues her one-act play.
EXT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLYARD - MOMENTS LATER
Teachers and students stand outside in jackets shivering.
JACOB
We couldn’t have done this in the
Gym? My ‘Members Only’ jacket is
meant for moving, not being still.
Ava appears from around the corner of the building.
AVA
Over here!
The teachers begrudgingly lug their students toward Ava.
AVA (CONT’D)
The district was so moved by my
plea that they approved an
emergency budget and sent us the
money right away!
(applause)
I thought “We’ll get the aides, get
the rugs, but then I thought- we
need something immediate!”
JANINE
Wait-
AVA
I always feel better right away
when I get my hair done. Thus, I do
better work, like I’m doing
currently. The Eagles are getting a
new stadium, and that will help
them play better inside of it-
JANINE (CONT'D)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 21.
JANINE
No, it won’t.
GREGORY
Stadium can’t make them the
Chiefs.
AVA
Fix the outside...
(points to hair)
Inside takes care of itself.
Ava points upward to the front of the building. A huge
plastic sheet falls over the old Harrity Elementary sign. It
reads “Willard R. Harrity Elementary” in green and white
lettering. There is a photo of Ava leaning on the letters.
JANINE
A... plastic sign? How’d you even
get this printed up so fast?
AVA
My cousin, Michael, is a signmaker!
He’s real fast and gave me a
rush deal. Thank God we got threethousand
dollars from the district
because I had to use all of it.
JANINE
You used all the money... on this?!
BARBARA
(to Janine, laughing)
Wanna do your little skit again?
INT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Janine, Gregory, and Jacob walk their kids back to class.
JANINE
I can’t believe this! She spent all
the money on theatrics! I thought
this type of workplace betrayal
only came from white ladies!
JACOB
Maybe Barbara and Melissa are
right. We just need to do the job-
JANINE
No, they can’t be right, ok? Ava is
the problem here. Not us! Where’s
your Malcolm X energy?!
GREGORY
I just got here, but she’s right.
This school needs order.
(MORE)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 22.
You’re never gonna get that with a
principal like this:
Gregory shows a TikTok of Ava doing the Renegade dance.
JANINE
...Wait, maybe she doesn’t have to
be principal.
INT. JANINE'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Janine types an email on her computer furiously.
JANINE (O.S.)
I’m going to email the
superintendent about this and
everything that Ava’s done today!
She should lose her job! Ava can’t
win here, because then, Barbara’s
right. And if she’s right, then
what does that say about me? I’m
not taking two L’s today. Actually,
it’d be three L’s because I got a
parking ticket this morning.
INT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
Barbara and Melissa head out for lunch.
MELISSA
I’m going to Wawa. Hey, you want a
pack of Christmas sprinkle
Tastykakes? I know they’re
seasonal, but I know a guy.
BARBARA
No, chile. Thank you. I’m going to
go get myself a salad from Mickey
D’s. I’m eating healthy.
Janine approaches the two from down the hallway.
JANINE
Hey, wait up! I’m going out to get
lunch, too!
MELISSA
Where ya going for lunch pipsqueak,
a bird feeder?
BARBARA
Figured you’d be working on your
next miracle from Saint Ava.
GREGORY (CONT'D)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 23.
JANINE
Ha-ha. No, don’t think I’ll need
anything from Ava ever again.
BARBARA
...And what does that mean?
JANINE
Well, I emailed the superintendent
and told him about how horrible Ava
is. No way she doesn’t get fired.
Melissa and Barbara stop in their tracks.
MELISSA
Oh, for the love of God!
JANINE
What?
BARBARA
Janine. The superintendent doesn’t
even see our emails, because he has
them bounced back to the person in
charge of wherever the email came
from...
JANINE
Wait... person in charge... that
means it went back to-
The “DING” of the loudspeaker sound goes off. Ava again:
AVA (O.S)
(stern)
Teachers. It has come to my
attention that some of you, one of
you, think it’s ok to go over my
head. I think we need to learn
about trust.
Janine, Melissa, and Barbara slowly turn to see Ava in her
office, staring at them, holding a microphone.
AVA (CONT’D)
So, over your lunch break- this
lunch break-, which I know you all
love so much, we will be having a
“trust workshop.” Where we learn
how to respect each other, Harrity
Elementary, and the chain of
command. It’s going to be FUN.
Janine gives a worried look to camera.
END OF ACT TWO
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 24.
ACT THREE
INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE - DAY
Janine, Barbara, Melissa, Jacob, Gregory, and more staff sit
in a semi-circle. Ava sits in the middle.
AVA
Thank you all for agreeing to be
here, mandatorily. We’re at a
crossroads. This is a crisis.
JANINE
No, a crisis is eating the
cafeteria pizza for lunch.
(takes a bite)
This just is yesterday’s burgers
mashed up and cut into triangles!
Ugh. Wait, Jacob did you go to the
corner store?
JACOB
(eating sandwich)
Yeah, the verbal harassment is
worth it. I think it might even
make it taste better.
GREGORY
Uh... why are we here?
AVA
Well, chocolate drop, I happened to
learn that one of the people here
doesn’t respect me. But, it’s not
about me. If you don’t respect
me... how can you respect this
school?
(then, off teachers’
confused looks)
You can’t... mathematically
impossible...
JACOB
Who doesn’t respect you... I
mean... the school, Ava?
AVA
You know, I don’t think that’s
important, Mr. Neil. We’re going to
make this a group matter, so as not
to single anyone out.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 25.
GREGORY
That’s nice.
AVA
Let’s do some trust exercises where
we say whatever we need to say out
loud to each other no matter how
critical. Let’s start with Janine.
Janine gives a horrified look to camera.
GREGORY
Wait, so she’ll get to say stuff
about other people?
AVA
No, Hershey Kiss, we’re going to
say things to her. You’re new...
let me give you an example. Janine?
JANINE
(sighs)
...Yes.
AVA
You’re over-energetic and annoying.
The teacher’s scoff in shock.
AVA (CONT’D)
No! It’s not bad! We’re sharing
with the goal of making us all
better. Constructive. See, Gregory?
GREGORY
Yup, got it. No need to-
AVA
Why don’t you try? Try on Janine.
GREGORY
I really don’t want to do that.
AVA
You’re right. Should be someone who
knows her better. Barbara? Jacob?
BARBARA
Absolutely not!
JACOB
Her hair is... I mean
absolutely not!
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 26.
MELISSA
Ava, no one’s gonna do this to
anyone. I’d make someone cry or
punch one of you in the face.
AVA
It doesn’t have to be rude! That’s
what I’m saying! I’ll prove it. I
prepared for this. Come in, Sheena!
An eight-year-old student, SHEENA, comes into the room.
JANINE
Ava! That’s my student! She should
be at lunch!
SHEENA
I am kinda hungry.
AVA
Sheena, remember what we talked
about? What’s a thing you wish was
different about Ms. Beeman?
Sheena looks shyly around the room. Mr. Johnson, the janitor,
who has been standing in the background all along speaks up.
MR. JOHNSON
She got some big feet.
Janine stands up.
JANINE
Ok, That’s enough. Everyone, I am
the person who “disrespected” Ava.
I emailed the superintendent to
tell him that Ava spent the
school’s money on a sign. I’m
sorry, Ava. I’m sorry everyone
missed lunch. Especially Sheena.
But, I did it because I care about
kids in this school, that shouldn’t
be a bad thing...
Janine sadly storms out of the room. Everyone is quiet.
AVA
(to group, sotto)
...Not a compelling speaker.
Charisma vacuum.
Barbara stares at Ava, shakes her head, and stands up.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 27.
BARBARA
You know what, Ava. Janine’s a lot
of things. Naive, overbearing-
AVA
Ooh, let me call her back in for
this-
BARBARA
But... she’s also right. Wanting to
actually help these kids shouldn’t
be a bad thing. I’ve worked in this
school district so long, I...
might’ve forgotten that.
Barbara walks out. Melissa and the others get up too.
BARBARA (CONT’D)
And where is everyone going?
JACOB
To check on Janine!
MELISSA
To lunch... check on Janine.
INT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
Janine stands outside the door of her classroom peering
through the small glass window. Barbara and the other
teachers walk up to her.
BARBARA
Janine, ignore Ava. And big feet
are a sign of fertility-
JANINE
Every lunch period, Barbara.
Janine points through the small window. Barbara walks up to
her. We see a small boy, JAMAL, sleeping on the floor.
JANINE (CONT’D)
Every single one, Jamal comes and
naps on the rug. He comes from a
rough home-
BARBARA
Yeah, he was in my class. Mom’s got
a lot of kids. Dad’s not around.
When he is, the parents fight.
JANINE
Right, right. So he doesn’t get
much sleep. Used to fall asleep
during morning lesson.
(MORE)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 28.
So, I told him if he stays up, he
can take a nap during lunch. I tell
him to sleep at his desk, but he
says the rug’s softer. Softer than
his bed at home.
Barbara’s look softens to Janine.
JANINE (CONT’D)
I don’t care whether you think I’m
good at this anymore. I care about
whether or not I can make change.
At Harrity. Where it’s needed most.
BARBARA
Janine, teachers at a school like
Harrity have to do be able to do it
all. We’re admin. We’re therapists.
We’re social workers. We’re second
parents. Sometimes, first. Why?
Sure as hell not the pay.
The teachers ad-lib agreements ending with Janine:
JANINE
My bathroom and kitchen are
basically one room.
MELISSA
We do this because we’re supposed
to. It’s a calling. You answered.
JANINE
Wow, I don’t know what to say.
JACOB
I believe it was brother Cornel
West who—
JANINE
Don’t.
BARBARA
I suggest we put our money together
and get Janine a rug. What ya’ll
think?
JANINE
No! You guys can’t do that. You
don’t have it. I know because I
have the same salary as you all and
my account’s in overdraft thanks to
that pesky Netflix payment. There
has to be another way.
JANINE (CONT'D)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 29.
BARBARA
Well, the school’s not giving you
money, and you won’t take ours.
What, you gonna steal a rug?
JANINE
Not me... but I know a guy who
knows a guy.
Janine turns to Melissa.
MELISSA
Let me see what I can do.
EXT. EAGLES STADIUM BUILD - DAY
The teachers stand outside of a loading dock at the stadium.
A SHADY MAN comes out of a side door with a rolled-up mat. He
hands it to Janine.
SHADY MAN
Alright, here ya go.
JANINE
Perfect, thank you so much!
Janine unrolls it to see that it’s a huge Eagles logo rug.
SHADY MAN
Swiped that from the VIP suites.
I’ll just tell them it got lost-
A second CONSTRUCTION WORKER comes out from the loading dock.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
What the hell is going on here?
Everyone freezes. They don’t know what to say. Janine steps
forward.
JANINE
Sir, I’m a teacher named Janine.
MELISSA
(through gritted teeth)
Don’t use your name.
JANINE
I’m not going to lie. We’re
stealing a rug from you. When I was
a kid, school was my ocean to other
worlds. I was a ship. And teachers
were my rudders.
(MORE)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 30.
Without them, I don’t know where
I’d be right now. So we’re just
trying to be good rudders. It’s
hard to explain, but these rugs are
islands-
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
You’re bad at giving speeches, but
I get it. A teacher changed my
life, too. Take it. Hell, take a
couple.
The teachers all smile excitedly and take rugs as Melissa
grabs something off the truck.
JACOB
Hey, mad props, my fellow!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Thanks, white boy.
JACOB
...Even the white guys now?
INT. HARRITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
The teachers all walk through the hallway with their new
rugs.
BARBARA
Ha-ha! These are nice. Thank you,
Melissa. And... thank you, Janine.
JANINE
You’re welcome. Feels good!
MELISSA
To finally get something you asked
for in this hell-hole?
JANINE
No... to finally feel like a
teacher.
MELISSA
Wait till ya realize you’ll never
own a home. You’ll be over the
moon.
Melissa, Barbara, and Jacob walk off leaving Janine and
Gregory.
JANINE (CONT'D)
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 31.
JANINE
Hey! Sorry we didn’t get to hang
more today. I... had to rob a
construction worker.
GREGORY
No problem, it was nice to watch a
teacher work. Made me see how
rewarding this job can be. But if
the police come asking me about
these rugs I’m snitching.
JANINE
Well, thank you. And look, I know
you said you’re a sub, but I hope
you stay. For the kids, I mean.
They don’t need any more turnovers.
GREGORY
Right. I’ll stick around. For the
kids.
JANINE
Good. And maybe we can get lunch
next week!
GREGORY TALKING HEAD
GREGORY
I can put up with the bodily fluids
a little longer. At least until
next week.
INT. JANINE’S CLASSROOM - DAY
Janine lays out her new rug onto the floor. Her kids sit on
it and she reads them a story.
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE
Today, was hard. Not my hardest day
here, though. Last year, I wore
squeaky sneakers. The kids called
me “Fart Feet.” I cried in the
supply closet. But today made me
better, I think. Better at this
job. I learned teachers really are
the only ones that can make change.
- Janine is watching a YouTube tutorial on her knees trying
to fix the reversy-toilet.
Harrity Elementary - Revised Network Draft - 1/29/21 32.
JANINE TALKING HEAD
JANINE (CONT’D)
Money would still be nice, though.
INT. JANINE’S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
As Janine is packing up to leave, Ava walks into her room.
JANINE
Oh. Ava... I’m sorry about earlier-
AVA
(angry)
Janine.
(then, happy)
Thank you so much for this limited
edition Eagles’ Swoop Jockstrap!
JANINE
Oh... I didn’t...
AVA
Don’t be coy! It’s not cute!
Really, my least favorite thing
about you! And that's saying
something. Barbara and Melissa told
me how all of you left that meeting
to get me this to apologize for
being vicious backstabbers!
Behind Ava at the door, Melissa and Barbara walk by. Barbara
gives Janine a wink.
BARBARA AND MELISSA TALKING HEAD
MELISSA
Swiped that from off the truck when
the construction workers weren’t
looking. Told her Jalen Hurts wore
it in a game.
BARBARA
Another key to making it in this
job- learn to make your incompetent
boss feel special. Janine will get
the hang of that, too.
